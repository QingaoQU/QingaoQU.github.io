Education
======
* B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong

Research experience
======
2021- present 
Working in Prof. YU Xinge’s group, do research in the field of Soft Bioelectronics
•	Flexible electronics project: self-sensing and haptic-reproducing electronic skin
Collaborated in design and fabrication of the flexible circuits and actuators based on electromagnetic force in multiple research project including the AR-VR interface and IoT communication with a primary focus on haptic information 
•	Flexible electronics project: sensor integrated swimming robots
Evaluated and optimized the performance of the robots, processed and analyzed experimental data
•	Soft robots project (Ongoing): Designed and fabricated the pneumatic soft robot integrated with multiple sensors, investigated the properties of the materials. Currently testing and the related piezoelectric sensor for mechanical property perception
•	Final year project (Ongoing): Adhesive hydrogel electrode patch for continuous blood pressure monitoring
Collaborated in design, validation, and optimization of the device. Currently building a machine learning model to extract the features that indicate the potential relationship between bioimpedance and blood pressure


2018-2019
Completed a science innovation project titled with “3D mouse based on gesture recognition” in high school
Designed a 3D mouse that enable gesture recognition and could accurately locate the user’s fingertip in 3-D space that eventually allows users to control computers without physical contact, making it particularly suitable for self-service machines in hospitals, where contact transmission needs to be minimized.
