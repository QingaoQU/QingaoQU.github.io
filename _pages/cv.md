Education
======
* B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong

Research experience
======
__2021- present__

Working in Prof. YU Xinge’s group, do research in the field of Soft Bioelectronics
  * Flexible electronics project: self-sensing and haptic-reproducing electronic skin

      Collaborated in the design and fabrication of flexible circuits and actuators based on electromagnetic force in multiple research projects, including        the AR-VR interface and IoT communication, with a primary focus on haptic information 
  * Flexible electronics project: sensor-integrated swimming robots
      Evaluated and optimized the performance of the robots, processed and analyzed experimental data
  *	Soft robots project (Ongoing): Designed and fabricated the pneumatic soft robot integrated with multiple sensors and investigated the properties of the materials. Currently, testing and the related piezoelectric sensor for mechanical property perception
  *	Final year project (Ongoing): Adhesive hydrogel electrode patch for continuous blood pressure monitoring
      Collaborated in the design, validation, and optimization of the device. Currently building a machine learning model to extract the features that indicate the potential relationship between bioimpedance and blood pressure

__2018-2019__

Completed a science innovation project titled “3D mouse based on gesture recognition” in high school
* Designed a 3D mouse that enables gesture recognition and could accurately locate the user’s fingertip in 3-D space, eventually allowing users to control computers without physical contact, making it particularly suitable for self-service machines in hospitals, where contact transmission needs to be minimized.
